# Random-Test-Generators-Demystified-Differences-and-Potential-for-Compiler-Reliability

Here are resources for reproducing the figures in our paper.

As long as the relative path relationship between the scripts and datas is maintained, you can run our scripts anywhere, and the relevant figures will be generated in PDF format at the path where the script is located.

The existing PDF were generated by R 4.4.2 and Python 3.12.0.

Test programs generated in our experiments can be obtained in: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/14735176)
